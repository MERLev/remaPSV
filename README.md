## FAQ

- How to open plugin menu ?
  - Press (start) + (square) whin in-game
- What can you do with gyro ?
  - You can remap gyro direction (up, down, left, right) to right stick directions to enable gyro aim in any game.
- How do I map combo of buttons ?
  - Combo mappings are not supported
- Is it possible to remap PS4Link keys
  - Yes, but a bit [tricky](https://github.com/MERLev/remaPSV2#known-issues)
- Is there a way to turn it on and off? Or does it save presets on a game by game basis?
  - ATM, no
- Is there any way to have this work on the save screen/system apps/livearea ?
  - ATM, no
- What is deadband under gyro menu ?
  - Deadband limits gyroscope sensivity, so smallest movements are ignored to handle shaking hands, and it is enabled by default in most vita games. Disabling it will higly increase sensivity of gyroscope.


## Known issues

- Menu not opening in Adrenaline, PS4link and some homebrew. 
  - Solution: To use plugin for such apps, you can follow those steps

    2. Configure everything as of doing it for desired app with menu not working.
    3. Go to settings -> save as Global config
    4. Open you desired app -> it should already be using global config and you remaps should be working
    5. Press (START) + (TRIANGLE) to save your global profile as current running game profile.
